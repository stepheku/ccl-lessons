ICT and informatics applications, such as electronic health records, order-entry, electronic medication administration, and computerized documentation systems, facilitate timely access to accurate and reliable patient information. These types of evidence-informed resources are essential for clinical decision making at the point of care (Canadian Nurses Association, 2001; Canadian Nurses Association, 2006b). Standardized structures and terminologies available through electronic health records data sets are enabling the capture of patient outcome data such as length of stay and adverse events, both important quality indicators for evaluating the impact of care (Kleib, Sales, Doran, Mallette, & White, 2011).\\n']\n"

      "Facilitating nurses’ informatics competency development through continuing education is paramount to enhance their readiness to practice safely and accurately in technologically enabled work environments.In this article, we briefly describe progress in nursing informatics (NI) and share a project exemplar that describes our experience in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a NI educational event, a one-day boot camp format that was used to provide foundational knowledge in NI targeted primarily at frontline nurses in Alberta, Canada.Overall, the boot camp was successful to raise nurses’ awareness about the importance of informatics in nursing practice.In today’s information-intensive healthcare industry, information and communication technology (ICT) and informatics are integral for any system to meet the needs of patients and providers and improve the quality and safety of the clinical environment (Canadian Nurses Association, 2006a; Canadian Nurses Association, 2006b; Poe, Abbott, & Pronovost, 2011).Nurse interactions with ICT can facilitate many opportunities for improvement in nursing practice, and can also impact the quality and safety of patient care (Canadian Nurses Association, 2006b; College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta [CARNA], 2009).For example, identifying patient outcomes relevant to nursing practice and measuring the effectiveness of nursing interventions in relation to improvements in these outcomes provides decision makers with an evidence-informed evaluation of the value of nurse contributions to healthcare.Evidence-based outcomes shape policy and practice directions to support nursing practice and knowledge development (Doran, 2011).Nurses, therefore, should “advocate for and lead efforts toward the collection, storage, retrieval and use of nursing data to generate information on nursing outcomes,” – a goal which can be realized by embracing and utilizing ICT effectively, as opposed to considering it as an add-on to current workload (Canadian Nurses Association, 2006b, p1).This paradox requires diligence to mitigate harm via user education and informatics competency development (Canadian Nurses Association, 2006b; Coiera et al., 2012; Darvish, Bahramnezhad, Keyhanian, & Navidhamidi, 2014).Utilizing informatics is among them and is often viewed as essential to accomplish the remaining four competencies (providing patient-centered care, applying quality improvement, working in interdisciplinary teams, and employing evidence-based practice) (Dreher & Fitzgerald Miller, 2006; Remus & Kennedy, 2012).In this article, we first briefly describe progress in NI and then share a project exemplar that describes our experience in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a NI educational event.We developed a one-day boot camp format that was used to provide foundational knowledge in NI targeted primarily at frontline nurses in Alberta, Canada.Progress in Nursing Informatics\n",
      "General Overview\n",
      "\n",
      "The profession of nursing was among the first health disciplines to embrace informatics through the recognition of nursing informatics (NI) as a specialty practice area (Bickford, 2015).NI is the \"science and practice (that) integrates nursing, its information and knowledge, with management of information and communication technologies to promote the health of people, families, and communities worldwide\" (International Medical Informatics Association, 2009, para.In a little over two decades, NI has evolved into an expanding body of knowledge, affirming its relevance and applicability to all domains of nursing (e.g., education, research, practice, administration).The evolution of NI is evident in the establishment of university-level NI education programs, and informatics dedicated professional organizations, standards and scope of practice, and certification (Anderson & Sensmeier, 2014; Bickford, 2015; HIMSS Nursing Informatics Awareness Task Force, 2007; Newbold, 2003).Opportunities for continuing education in NI (e.g., workshops, webinars, boot camps, NI institutes) are also available to meet professional development needs of nurses in a variety of practice settings.Defining NI competencies for nurses at generalist and advanced levels of practice (Staggers, Gassert, & Curran, 2002) and the development of initiatives such as the Quality and Safety Education for Nurses (QSEN) (Barton & Skiba, 2009) and the Technology Informatics Guiding Education Reform (TIGER) in the United States (Schlak & Troseth, 2013) has facilitated and promoted NI in practice and academia.The impact and value of nurses with advanced level of NI education is also becoming more evident.A recent survey demonstrated that organizations employing nursing informatics professionals in executive leadership roles for a long period of time reported better clinical system processes and better overall quality of care for patients.Results also showed that nursing informatics professionals have a direct impact on the quality of patient care, workflow, patient safety, and user acceptance of clinical systems (Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, 2015).Informatics in Canada\n",
      "\n",
      "In Canada, early attempts to identify NI competencies for Canadian nurses were brought forward by Hebert (2000) who proposed that Canadian nurses should have both skills and knowledge in NI.Hebert suggested that nurses should be able to “use information and communication, interpret and organize data, and combine information to contribute to knowledge development in nursing” (2000, p.3).To promote readiness among nurses, the E-Nursing Strategy for Canada recommended that nurses should have opportunities to support competency development for ICT use; have access to ICT to support evidence-based care; and be actively involved in the selection, design, deployment, and evaluation of ICT (Canadian Nurses Association, 2006a).In 2012, the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing (CASN) identified a list of NI competencies that all registered nurses should possess upon entry-to-practice (CASN, 2012).The Canadian model is unique in providing a concise list that addresses key knowledge, skills and attitudes related to using technology in the context of patient care and in highlighting and mapping regulatory and accountability responsibilities to nurses’ scope of practice and code of ethics.In addition, CASN, in collaboration with Canada Health Infoway, also published the CASN/Infoway Nursing Informatics Teaching Toolkit: Supporting the Integration of Nursing Informatics Competencies into Nursing Curricula resource for nurse educators (CASN, 2013) to facilitate integrating informatics in undergraduate nursing education.More recently, CASN and Infoway launched the Digital Health Nursing Faculty Peer Leader Network, a project currently underway to support nursing faculty in integrating consumer health informatics and digital health in nursing curricula.Similar initiatives are much needed to support nurses in practice settings as they are at the forefront of using patient care technology.While most nurses do recognize the benefits and potential of ICT and health informatics applications to improve the quality of health information and healthcare delivery, many continue to find it difficult to identify the relevance of NI and its application in their individual practice settings (Canadian Nurses Association, 2001; Canadian Nurses Association & Canada Health Infoway, 2014; Nagle, 2013).Practicing nurses belong to different generational groups that have had varying exposure to informatics education and sometimes limited opportunities to utilize ICT in their personal and professional lives (Bell, 2013).In one study of factors associated with computer literacy among nurses, the authors found that computer experience of nurses and personal innovation in information technology were associated with computer literacy and computer anxiety (Hsu, Hsiao, Huang, & Lin, 2006).In another study, basic computer skills and formal informatics education were identified as factors associated with nurses’ informatics competency development (Hwang & Park, 2011).(2014) found that level of education, nursing administration experience, and informatics training/education were significant factors affecting competency levels.In a national survey (n=992) of Canadian nurses’ use of digital health technologies in practice, results showed that less than three in four nurses used a combination of paper and electronic records; however variations existed per clinical practice setting (Canadian Nurses Association & Canada Health Infoway, 2014).As healthcare continues to further use ICTs, assisting nurses develop desired levels of informatics competencies and identifying mechanisms to engage them in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of health technologies is paramount for successful transitions to digital applications.In the next section, we describe a project recently designed and implemented to support the development of informatics competencies for nurses in Alberta, Canada.Project Exemplar: The Inaugural Alberta Nursing Informatics Boot Camp\n",
      "The province of Alberta has over 35,000 registered nurses that are highly regarded for their competent professional practice.As the largest group of healthcare professionals in Alberta affected by these transformations, identifying mechanisms to support nurses’ informatics educational needs became a priority.In this section, we share our experience in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of a nursing informatics educational day, the inaugural, Alberta Nursing Informatics Boot Camp: Advancing Nursing Practice through Informatics, hosted and coordinated by MacEwan University, Centre for Professional Nursing Education (CPNE) and supported by Alberta Health Services.In concluding, we offer some recommendations for practice leaders, policy makers, educators, and researchers regarding supporting informatics competency development in nursing.Identifying Key NI Educational Needs and Target Audience\n",
      "\n",
      "NI is an emerging specialty area with applications in all practice settings; its use continues to present challenges for nurses, professional regulatory bodies, nursing education institutions, and healthcare organizations.Although CASN defined entry-to-practice NI competencies for Registered Nurses in 2012, to date there is limited evidence to inform the status of NI competencies and educational needs among nurses in Canada, and specifically Alberta (Canadian Nurses Association & Canada Health Infoway, 2014; Nagle & Clarke, 2004).There are no national mandates to enforce adoption of NI competencies in nursing education and practice.A professional role responsibility of nurses is to identify gaps in NI competencies and seek appropriate professional development opportunities (CARNA, 2009).The Nursing Informatics Association of Alberta (NIAA) is a specialty practice group founded in 2013 to engage Alberta nurses in learning about the role of informatics in nursing practice and create educational opportunities to support NI competency development (Canadian Nurses Association, 2006b; Kleib, Shaben, Zimka, & Kwan, 2013).NIAA provides a forum for professional dialogue about important issues in NI and opportunities for networking and continuing education through scheduled bi-monthly, one-hour educational sessions on various NI topics.The MacEwan University CPNE has identified informatics education as a priority area.The goal was thus to provide comprehensive, clinically relevant, easily-accessible educational opportunities for NI to meet the educational needs of frontline nurses in Alberta, our target audience, who may not be aware of NIAA or the CASN NI competencies.A one-day continuing education event offered focused learning about concepts of health and nursing informatics and their potential to improve healthcare delivery and patient outcomes across the continuum of care.Because this was the first educational event in Alberta of this kind, our goal was to focus on foundational knowledge to meet the needs of most frontline nurses, regardless of their previous knowledge in informatics.Session topics included:\n",
      "\n",
      "an overview of informatics in healthcare, including a discussion of its relevance to nurses’ work and CASN competencies and resources for developing these competencies;\n",
      "computer and information literacy applications in healthcare;\n",
      "common information systems used in healthcare, with an emphasis on computerized documentation tools and their benefits in capturing nurses’ contributions to patient care; and\n",
      "a knowledge application session.Planning Budget Requirements\n",
